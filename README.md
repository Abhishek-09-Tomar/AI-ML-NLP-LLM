# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects focused on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and other **Data Science** applications. Dive into my projects and explore the power of data-driven solutions.

## Technologies and Tools Used

### **Machine Learning**

The primary programming language used for building all the projects in this repository.

### **Libraries and Frameworks**
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling large datasets.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis with high-performance data structures.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and creating plots.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for data mining and analysis.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For deep learning models and neural networks.
- **XGBoost**: For gradient boosting models to improve accuracy.

## Projects

### **1. Real Estate Price Prediction**
A machine learning model that predicts property prices based on various features like location, size, and amenities.

### **2. Spam Email Detection**
A machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or legitimate based on email content and features.
